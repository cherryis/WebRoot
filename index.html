               I love to solve problems always as my hobby.
Whenever I solve issues, I feel so good. That made me keep tracking my Software Development study. Learning new things through research increases my knowledge and self-confidence. I love colorful and catching someoneâ€™s needs. I want to collaborate all my skill sets of design, problem-solving, researching, and analysis for creating new applications in the future.
